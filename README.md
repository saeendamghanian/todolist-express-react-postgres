# todolist-express-react-postgres
This is a to do list project with Express, React and PostgreSQL. 

1. For using this project you need to have at first **npm** on your machine.
2. Then should install (**Express, pg, body-parser, cors**) on *todolist-server* folder and (**axios, React, React-dom**) on *todolist-client* folder through **npm**.
3. At last should run the project from the *root folder* which there are these three file and folders (**package.json, todolist-server, todolist-client**) inside it, with `npm start` command.
4. One more thing, for running the *front-end* and *back-end* **at the same time** you need to install *concurrently* through **npm** inside the *root folder* which include the three other file and folders (package.json, todolist-server, todolist-client).

**GOOD LUCK**
